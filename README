mp3rename
=========

Rename MP3 files according to ID3 info tags.

mp3rename will read the ID3 information from the given input file(s)
and use it to rename the file(s) to a standardized name. Care is taken
to not overwrite existing files.

Default file name format is Artist/Album_Title/Track_Number_Track_Title.mp3.

With command line option --various-artists selected, this becomes:
Various/Album_Title/Artist:_Track_Number_Track_Title.mp3.

Attempts are made to sanitize the filename components: underscores
instead of spaces, all words titlecased, and problematic characters
avoided. Track numbers are always two digits.
